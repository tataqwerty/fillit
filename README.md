# fillit

This is a project of school 42 made by me. This program takes a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos , and arrange them in order to create the smallest square possible.The main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time. Tetriminos is a 4x4 square and it has 4 hastags(#).

Firstly, you should execute command "make";
It will compile binary file "fillit", and after that you should write "./fillit file\_success" or "./fillit file\_error".
